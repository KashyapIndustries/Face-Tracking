What to do if you screw up and uninstall raspberry pi and how to get cv2 running again.

Hello Amogh, I assume you were being a stupid idiot and somehow screwed the whole pi and had to redownload it.

Well I'm here to tell you how. First I want you to go to Idle, Hover over file and click path browsers.
I want you to click as many of the pluses you can see, mainley the folders. Then i want you to create a new "python" file.

Go to terminal and do this:
paste "sudo raspi-config" and go down and select "Interfacing Options". From here, go to camera and enable it. Reboot after this/


After rebooting, go to terminal and paste these two:
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
sudo pip install imutils

Now cv2 and sometihing else is installed:)


Then to make sure camera is working and connected do this: 
raspistill -o cam.jpg

Then download the files:
"facedetect.py" and the"harcascade_frontalface_default.xmlone and put them in your Python folder. Ten go to this folder by using the command "cd Python'.

Then I want you to follow this format for any other files you want to run:

python facedetect.py haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

This basically tells python to run both the programs facedetect and haarcascade. There can be one program or many more programs, but
it has to follow this format.
